# Thermodynamics of prethermalizing systems

## Very brief intro

This work is based on [Prethermalization from a low-density Holstein-Primakoff expansion](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=it&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Prethermalization+from+a+low-density+Holstein-Primakoff+expansion&btnG=) where a transverse-field Ising chain is subject to a quench that changes the strength of the external field and adds a long-range interaction among the spins of the chain. This kind of perturbation gives rise to a prethermal behaviour due to the fact that it keeps intact a number of the original symmetries of the system. \\
The goal of the project is to study the thermodynamics of such a system investigating the contribution of initial coherences to thermodynamic quantitites such as work and entropy production, relying on the fact that the prethermal metastable states are Generalized Gibbs ensembles and thus retain some memory of the initial datum. \\
This is still w.i.p.
